A: Credit limit increase offers are based on quarterly data from Credit Bureaus received through monitoring cycles. It's possible that your approval was based on information from a previous cycle. If the freeze or lock remains during the next update, you won't receive further offers until it's removed. Additionally, QAB may have used data from another Credit Bureau where no freeze was placed, so it's recommended to verify this with the Credit Bureaus.

Q: I’ve removed the freeze or lock from my bureau. How do I put it back on?
A: The process of adding or removing a freeze or lock is managed by your Credit Bureau. Contact them directly to reinstate a freeze or lock on your account.

A: Yes, once applied, the security freeze or lock remains in place even if you've moved to another province. It persists on your file until you choose to remove it.
