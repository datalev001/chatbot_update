# Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot with LangChain and Flask in Python
Exploring Techniques for Constructing a Stable AI Chatbot
Introduction 
If you are interested in mastering the techniques of building an AI Chatbot application by leveraging the sophisticated features of GPT-4, OpenAI API, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain, Python Flask, conversational session management, and beyond, this guide is perfectly tailored for you.

Despite the integration of various technologies in this project, my goal is straightforward: to develop a knowledge base chatbot with an HTML/JavaScript interface designed to respond to user inquiries within a specific domain, such as the credit card business, as demonstrated in this project. Throughout this guide, I will walk you through the essential techniques, offering Python and HTML code snippets that can serve as templates for constructing more sophisticated intelligent agents.
